## Overview of Project
The client has requested a dashboard of demographic information, graphs, and charts to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, users should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. This will help users identify whether a species is found in their navel.

## Resources
Data Source: sample.json

Software: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Plotly
